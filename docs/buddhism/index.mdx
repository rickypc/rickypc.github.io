<Welcome />

The heart of [Buddhist teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) lies in [Dependent Origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da), shaped and driven by [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Karma).

<Pratityasamutpada />

## Karma Oversimplified

Think of [karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism) as
a long-running [personal balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet#Personal) -
good karma adds to your [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset),
while bad karma becomes a [liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)).

Our birth as human beings is shaped by unresolved karmic debts,
and life offers us the opportunity to settle them.

The idea sounds simple, but life makes it complicated very quickly.
Karma touches every choice, every habit, every relationship.
You only begin to truly see and understand it when you pause to re-evaluate
your life again and again - day after day, for some time.
With patience, the pattern becomes clearer, and acceptance follows naturally.

<PancaSila />

## Paying Off Karma Debts

Settling karmic debts helps reduce the risk of unresolved karma surfacing unexpectedly.
And it's worth remembering - being [reborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)) as a human is never guaranteed.

Each debt we resolve brings us closer to the end of suffering.
It's truly possible to break free from the cycle ([nirodha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirodha)) and move toward
lasting peace and liberation ([nibbāna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism))).

## Liberation Through Prayers

One of the most accessible ways to begin clearing karmic debts is through
[liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Paths_to_liberation) prayers - such as [Āryatārā Atiyoga](arya-tara-atiyoga.mdx).
These practices offer a direct path toward healing, release, and spiritual progress.

## Is This For Real?

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) offers insight into some of life's deepest questions:

- Why are we born into certain families?
- Why do we cross paths with specific people?
- Why are we born at all?
- What's the purpose of our life?
- Why do we die?

The answer, in Buddhist terms, is that it's all the result of our own actions.
We shape our reality through karma - and we hold the power to change it.

Paying off karmic debts isn't just beneficial - it's essential.
[Human life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_beings_in_Buddhism#Qualities_of_human_life) is rare and valuable because it gives us the best chance
to resolve those debts. Other forms of existence, like that of a pig,
make spiritual practice far more difficult.

> It is easy to doubt the law of [kamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism).
  We see so many people who do good deeds and seem to gain no benefit.
  So many people do bad things and become rich and successful.
>
> The [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha) said that the results
  of [kamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism) will only appear rapidly
  if the surroundings allow it. For example, a corrupt person in a corrupt
  environment will receive the kammic results of his bad actions much more slowly
  than a corrupt person in an environment that values honesty.
  Sooner or later, however, the results will manifest.
>
> Most important to note is that every time that we act with a good, kind,
  noble intention then those qualities are immediately strengthened in our hearts.
  And so with selfish, cruel intentions.
  This strengthening of good and bad qualities in the heart is
  the perceivable result of [kamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism),
  which we do not merely believe in, but can see for ourselves.
>
> -- [Ajahn Jayasāro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Jayas%C4%81ro)

According to the [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha),
[truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_in_Buddhism) isn't something we can grasp through
[common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense) or [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning) alone.
Real understanding comes from direct experience -
or from the insight of those [who've walked the path with wisdom](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Dhammapada/Chapter_6).

> “Now, [Kālāmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81l%C4%81ma), don’t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture,
by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views,
by probability, or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’
When you know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are skillful;
these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the observant;
these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness’—
then you should enter & remain in them.
>
> -- [Kalama Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta)

The Buddha laid out clear [criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta#Discerning_Religious_Teachings) for how a thoughtful person can discern
which teachings to trust. He cautioned against blindly accepting
religious claims - whether they come from tradition, authority,
or even sophisticated techniques.

Instead, he emphasized direct experience. Truth, in the Buddhist path,
isn't something handed down - it's something tested, lived, and verified.
Through ongoing reflection and personal inquiry, we discover which teachings
genuinely reduce [suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering) ([dukkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha))
and lead us toward greater clarity and peace.

## How About God?

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) doesn't center around a creator God - it focuses on ourselves.
The [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha) isn't a deity, but a spiritual teacher who showed the path
to liberation.

We're the ones who accumulate karma, and we're also responsible for
resolving it. It's like taking out a mortgage - you wouldn't expect
someone else, not even Buddha or God, to pay it off for you.
The path is ours to walk.
