    > Through many births I wandered in saṃsāra, seeking,
      but not finding the builder of this house,
      painful is repeated existence!<br />
    > Householder, you are seen now, you must build no house again,
      your rafters are broken, and your ridge pole is shattered,
      to dissolution goes my mind, achieved is the destruction of craving.
