notes come from my ongoing study and practice of Buddhism. They began in the early 1990s, when I learned from two Tibetan monks from India at a small temple in Surabaya, Indonesia. I no longer remember their names, but I now know with certainty that they were monks of the Drikung Kagyu lineage - one of the main branches of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. They wore the deep maroon robes typical of the Kagyu tradition, with small touches of yellow in the upper garments, a style I only later learned to recognize. One of the earliest impressions that stayed with me was the presence of a Tara statue in the temple. Even as a teenager, I felt an immediate and natural connection to her—something I didn't fully understand at the time. That early affinity never faded. Tara would later become central in my Dzogchen practice, and she remains my yidam today. In hindsight, this thread of connection feels like the most continuous element of my path. Another memory that confirmed the Drikung Kagyu lineage was the initiation ceremony for a newly ordained monk. The teachers explained the meaning of the small dot marks placed on the shaved head—symbols representing vows, discipline, and stages of monastic commitment. It was a simple conversation shared between friends and teachers, but it reflected a distinctly Drikung way of transmitting the tradition: direct, humble, and quietly profound. Looking back, there is no doubt that my earliest training came from this lineage. Although I later continued my studies through Dzogchen, rooted in the Nyingma tradition, I still regard those first two Drikung Kagyu monks as my primary teachers. The teachings I've received since then complement rather than contradict what I learned in those early years. These notes are not authoritative or comprehensive. They're simply a way for me to organize what I've learned - concepts, practices, and reflections - and to make them available in case they're helpful to others.","s":"Notes","u":"/docs/","h":"","p":3},{"i":7,"t":"The Buddha summarized the entire path in four profound insights: There is suffering (dukkha).

Don't take what isn't yours If it doesn't belong to you, leave it. Sharing is good, stealing is not. Don't break trust in love Be honest and kind in friendships and relationships.

Dependent origination instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few. Those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathāgata has declared their cause. And that which is the cessation of them, thus the great renunciant (sramana) has taught. Through ignorance, karma is accumulated, karma is the cause of (re)birth. Through knowledge, karma is not accumulated, through absence of karma, one is not (re)born.

We see good people suffer and bad people succeed. The Buddha explained that karma ripens only when conditions allow it. A corrupt person in a corrupt environment may not face consequences quickly. But in a place that values honesty, the same actions would bring results much sooner. It is easy to doubt the law of kamma. We see so many people who do good deeds and seem to gain no benefit. So many people do bad things and become rich and successful. The Buddha said that the results of kamma will only appear rapidly if the surroundings allow it. For example, a corrupt person in a corrupt environment will receive the kammic results of his bad actions much more slowly than a corrupt person in an environment that values honesty. Sooner or later, however, the results will manifest. Most important to note is that every time that we act with a good, kind, noble intention then those qualities are immediately strengthened in our hearts. And so with selfish, cruel intentions. This strengthening of good and bad qualities in the heart is the perceivable result of kamma, which we do not merely believe in, but can see for ourselves. -- Ajahn Jayasāro Most importantly, karma is visible right now: Every kind intention strengthens kindness. Every selfish intention strengthens selfishness.

Having made offerings to as many Buddhas as there are in ninety-nine sesame seed pods - that is how much merit we create and we are always guided by that many Buddhas. गुह्यधातुकरण्ड नमस्त्र्यध्विकानां सर्वतथागतानां । ॐ भुविभवनवरे वचनवचति । सुरु सुरु धर धर । सर्व तथागतधातु धरे पद्मं भवति । जयवरे मुद्रे । स्मर तथागत धर्मचक्र प्रवर्तन वज्रे बोधि मण्डालङ् कारालङ् कृते । सर्व तथागताधिष्ठिते । बोधय बोधय बोधि बोधि बुध्य बुध्य । संबोधनि संबोधय । चल चल चलन्तु सर्वावरणानि । सर्व पापविगते । हुरु हुरु सर्व शोकविगते । सर्व तथागत हृदय वज्रिणि । संभार संभार । सर्व तथागत गुह्य धारणी मुद्रे । भूते सुभूते । सर्व तथागताधिष्ठितधातु गर्भे स्वाहा । समयाधिष्ठिते स्वाहा । सर्व तथागत हृदय धातु मुद्रे स्वाहा । सुप्रतिष्ठितस्तूपे तथागताधिष्ठिते हुरु हुरु हूं हूं स्वाहा । ॐ सर्व तथागतोष्णीष धातु मुद्राणि सर्व तथागत सधातु विभूषिताधिष्ठिते हूं हूं स्वाहा॥ 𑖐𑖲𑖮𑖿𑖧𑖠𑖯𑖝𑖲𑖎𑖨𑖜𑖿𑖚 𑖡𑖦𑖭𑖿𑖝𑖿𑖨𑖿𑖧𑖠𑖿𑖪𑖰𑖎𑖯𑖡𑖯𑖽 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝𑖯𑖡𑖯𑖽 𑗂 𑖌𑖼 𑖥𑖲𑖪𑖰𑖥𑖪𑖡𑖪𑖨𑖸 𑖪𑖓𑖡𑖪𑖓𑖝𑖰 𑗂 𑖭𑖲𑖨𑖲 𑖭𑖲𑖨𑖲 𑖠𑖨 𑖠𑖨 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝𑖠𑖯𑖝𑖲 𑖠𑖨𑖸 𑖢𑖟𑖿𑖦𑖽 𑖥𑖪𑖝𑖰 𑗂 𑖕𑖧𑖪𑖨𑖸 𑖦𑖲𑖟𑖿𑖨𑖸 𑗂 𑖭𑖿𑖦𑖨 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝 𑖠𑖨𑖿𑖦𑖓𑖎𑖿𑖨 𑖢𑖿𑖨𑖪𑖨𑖿𑖝𑖡 𑖪𑖕𑖿𑖨𑖸 𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖰 𑖦𑖜𑖿𑖚𑖯𑖩𑖒𑖿 𑖎𑖯𑖨𑖯𑖩𑖒𑖿 𑖎𑖴𑖝𑖸 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝𑖯𑖠𑖰𑖬𑖿𑖙𑖰𑖝𑖸 𑗂 𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖧 𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖧 𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖰 𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖰 𑖤𑖲𑖠𑖿𑖧 𑖤𑖲𑖠𑖿𑖧 𑗂 𑖭𑖽𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖡𑖰 𑖭𑖽𑖤𑖺𑖠𑖧 𑗂 𑖓𑖩 𑖓𑖩 𑖓𑖩𑖡𑖿𑖝𑖲 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪𑖯𑖪𑖨𑖜𑖯𑖡𑖰 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖢𑖯𑖢𑖪𑖰𑖐𑖝𑖸 𑗂 𑖮𑖲𑖨𑖲 𑖮𑖲𑖨𑖲 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖫𑖺𑖎𑖪𑖰𑖐𑖝𑖸 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝 𑖮𑖴𑖟𑖧 𑖪𑖕𑖿𑖨𑖰𑖜𑖰 𑗂 𑖭𑖽𑖥𑖯𑖨 𑖭𑖽𑖥𑖯𑖨 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝 𑖐𑖲𑖮𑖿𑖧 𑖠𑖯𑖨𑖜𑖱 𑖦𑖲𑖟𑖿𑖨𑖸 𑗂 𑖥𑖳𑖝𑖸 𑖭𑖲𑖥𑖳𑖝𑖸 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝𑖯𑖠𑖰𑖬𑖿𑖙𑖰𑖝𑖠𑖯𑖝𑖲 𑖐𑖨𑖿𑖥𑖸 𑖭𑖿𑖪𑖯𑖮𑖯 𑗂 𑖭𑖦𑖧𑖯𑖠𑖰𑖬𑖿𑖙𑖰𑖝𑖸 𑖭𑖿𑖪𑖯𑖮𑖯 𑗂 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝 𑖮𑖴𑖟𑖧 𑖠𑖯𑖝𑖲 𑖦𑖲𑖟𑖿𑖨𑖸 𑖭𑖿𑖪𑖯𑖮𑖯 𑗂 𑖭𑖲𑖢𑖿𑖨𑖝𑖰𑖬𑖿𑖙𑖰𑖝𑖭𑖿𑖝𑖳𑖢𑖸 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝𑖯𑖠𑖰𑖬𑖿𑖙𑖰𑖝𑖸 𑖮𑖲𑖨𑖲 𑖮𑖲𑖨𑖲 𑖮𑖳𑖽 𑖮𑖳𑖽 𑖭𑖿𑖪𑖯𑖮𑖯 𑗂 𑖌𑖼 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝𑖺𑖬𑖿𑖜𑖱𑖬 𑖠𑖯𑖝𑖲 𑖦𑖲𑖟𑖿𑖨𑖯𑖜𑖰 𑖭𑖨𑖿𑖪 𑖝𑖞𑖯𑖐𑖝 𑖭𑖠𑖯𑖝𑖲 𑖪𑖰𑖥𑖳𑖬𑖰𑖝𑖯𑖠𑖰𑖬𑖿𑖙𑖰𑖝𑖸 𑖮𑖳𑖽 𑖮𑖳𑖽 𑖭𑖿𑖪𑖯𑖮𑖯𑗃 གསང་བ་རིང་བསྲེལ ན་མ་སྟྲྱ་དྷྭི་ཀཱ་ནཱཾ་སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏཱ་ནཱཾ། ༀ་བྷུ་བི་བྷ་བ་ན་བ་རེ་བ་ཙ་ན་བ་ཙ་ཏི། སུ་རུ་སུ་རུ་དྷ་ར་དྷ་ར། སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏ་དྷཱ་ཏུ་དྷ་རེ་པ་དྨཾ་བྷ་བ་ཏི། ཛ་ཡ་བ་རེ་མུ་དྲེ། སྨ་ར་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏ་དྷ་རྨ་ཙ་ཀྲ་པྲ་བ་རྟ་ན་བ་ཛྲེ་བོ་དྷི་མ་ཎྜཱ་ལ་ང་ཀཱ་རཱ་ལ་ང་ཀྲྀ་ཏེ། སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏཱ་དྷི་ཥྛི་ཏེ། བོ་དྷ་ཡ་བོ་དྷཡ་བོ་དྷི་བོ་དྷི་བུ་དྷྱ་བུ་དྷྱ། སཾ་བོ་དྷ་ནི་སཾ་བོ་དྷ་ཡ། ཙ་ལ་ཙ་ལ་ཙ་ལ་ནྟུ་ས་རྦཱ་བ་ར་ཎཱ་ནི། སརྦ་པཱ་པ་བི་ག་ཏེ། ཧུ་རུ་ཧུ་རུ་སརྦ་ཤོ་ཀ་བི་ག་ཏེ། སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏ་ཧྲྀ་ད་ཡ་བ་ཛྲི་ཎི། སཾ་བྷཱ་ར་སཾ་བྷཱ་ར། སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏ་གུ་ཧྱ་དྷཱ་ར་ཎཱི་མུ་དྲེ། བྷཱུ་ཏེ་སུ་བྷཱུ་ཏེ། སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏཱ་དྷི་ཥྛི་ཏ་དྷཱ་ཏུ་ག་རྦྷེ་སྭཱ་ཧཱ། ས་མ་ཡཱ་དྷི་ཥྛི་ཏེ་སྭཱ་ཧཱ། སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏ་ཧྲྀ་ད་ཡ་དྷཱ་ཏུ་མུ་དྲེ་སྭཱ་ཧཱ། སུ་པྲ་ཏི་ཥྛི་ཏ་སྟཱུ་པེ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏཱ་དྷི་ཥྛི་ཏེ་ཧུ་རུ་ཧུ་རུ་ཧཱུཾ་ཧཱུཾ་སྭཱ་ཧཱ། ༀ་སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏོ་ཥྞཱི་ཥ་དྷཱ་ཏུ་མུ་དྲཱ་ཎི་སརྦ་ཏ་ཐཱ་ག་ཏ་ས་དྷཱ་ཏུ་བི་བྷཱུ་ཥི་ཏཱ་དྷི་ཥྛི་ཏེ་ཧཱུཾ་ཧཱུཾ་སྭཱ་ཧཱ༎","s":"Guhyadhātukaraṇḍa","u":"/docs/buddhism/practical-daily-practice/phrases/","h":"#guhyadhātukaraṇḍa","p":216},{"i":265,"t":"oṃ sambhara sambhara vimānasara mahājapa hūṃ । oṃ smara smara vimānaskara mahājapa hūṃ॥ 3x The prayer blessing. जप ॐ सांभारा सांभारा विमानसारा महाजप हूं । ॐ स्मरा स्मरा विमानस्कारा महाजप हूं॥","s":"Japa","u":"/docs/buddhism/practical-daily-practice/phrases/","h":"#japa","p":216},{"i":267,"t":"oṃ virāji virāji mahā-cakra-vajri । sata sata sarate sarate trayī trayī vidhamani saṃbhañjani । tramati siddhā gryatvaṃ svāhā॥ This prayer can help achieve success in all prayer cultivation.

Think of them like gentle reminders to stay kind and careful: Don't hurt living beings Every creature wants to live. Be gentle with people, animals, even tiny bugs. Don't take what isn't yours If it doesn't belong to you, leave it. Sharing is good, stealing is not. Don't break trust in love Be honest and kind in friendships and relationships. Don't cause harm with your choices. Don't lie Words can heal or hurt. Speak the truth, and use words to help, not harm. Don't cloud your mind Stay clear and mindful. Avoid things that make you lose control or forget kindness. Following these precepts keeps your \"karmic balance sheet\" clean - fewer new debts, fewer complications, more peace. पञ्चशील पाणातिपाता वेरमणी सिख्खापदं समादियामि । अदिन्नादाना वेरमणी सिख्खापदं समादियामि । कामेसु मिच्छाचार वेरमणी सिख्खापदं समादियामि । मुसावादा वेरमणी सिख्खापदं समादियामि । सुरामेरय मज्जपमादट्ठाना वेरमणी सिख्खापदं समादियामि॥ පන්සිල් පාණාතිපාතා වේරමණී සික්ඛාපදං සමාදියාමි . අදින්නාදානා වේරමණී සික්ඛාපදං සමාදියාමි . කාමේසු මිච්ඡාචාරා වේරමණී සික්ඛාපදං සමාදියාමි . මුසාවාදා වේරමණී සික්ඛාපදං සමාදියාමි . සුරාමේරය මජ්ජපමාදට්ඨානා වේරමණී සික්ඛාපදං සමාදියාමි෴ 五戒 巴那帝巴大 唯臘媽尼 昔卡巴當 三媽地呀密 · 阿地那他那 唯臘媽尼 昔卡巴當 三媽地呀密 · 葛美舒 米恰遮拉 唯臘媽尼 昔卡巴當 三媽地呀密 · 木沙哇他 唯臘媽尼 昔卡巴當 三媽地呀密 · 穌拉美拉呀 媽車巴媽達它那 唯臘媽尼 昔卡巴當 三媽地呀密。","s":"Pañcaśīla","u":"/docs/buddhism/practical-daily-practice/phrases/","h":"#pañcaśīla","p":216},{"i":297,"t":"oṃ dhare dhare bandhare svāhā । jayā jayā siddhi siddhi phala phala । a āḥ śa sa ma ha । mama koling samanta॥ 3x Dedication. परिणमन ॐ धरे धरे बंधरे स्वहा । जय जय सिद्धि सिद्धि फल फल । अ आ शा स म ह । मम कॉलिंग समन्त॥","s":"Pariṇāmanā","u":"/docs/buddhism/practical-daily-practice/phrases/","h":"#pariṇāmanā","p":216},{"i":299,"t":"oṃ gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā॥ 3x All Buddhas of the three ages (past, present and future) rely on the Perfection of Wisdom to reach unexcelled complete Enlightenment.

Dependent origination instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few. Those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathāgata has declared their cause. And that which is the cessation of them, thus the great renunciant (sramana) has taught. Through ignorance, karma is accumulated, karma is the cause of (re)birth. Through knowledge, karma is not accumulated, through absence of karma, one is not (re)born.

The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra and while there are various interpretations of the symbolism in twilight language, the masculine figure is representing the compassion (karuṇā) and skillful means (upāya-kauśalya) that have to be developed in order to reach enlightenment. While the feminine partner is representing wisdom (prajñā) which is also necessary to enlightenment. United, the figures symbolize the union necessary to overcome the veils of Maya, the false duality of object and subject.

The union is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of compassion and wisdom, depicted as a male deity in union with his female consort through the similar ideas of interpenetration or coalescence (Sanskrit: युगनद्ध, Romanized: Yuganaddha, Chinese: 雙連, Tibetan: ཟུང་འཇུག, Wylie: zung-'jug, THL: zunjuk), using the concept of Indra's net to illustrate this. The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra and while there are various interpretations of the symbolism in twilight language, the masculine figure is representing the compassion (karuṇā) and skillful means (upāya-kauśalya) that have to be developed in order to reach enlightenment. While the feminine partner is representing wisdom (prajñā) which is also necessary to enlightenment. United, the figures symbolize the union necessary to overcome the veils of Maya, the false duality of object and subject.

Dependent origination instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few. Those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathāgata has declared their cause.

Dependent origination instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few. Those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathāgata has declared their cause.

Add the first strip, roll 2 cm, then add the second, roll 2 cm, then add the third and roll all the way. Keep rolling with control As you add strips (single or grouped), hold both ends of the incense stick to help guide the roll and keep it tight. Tighten the roll Once all strips are added, roll the prayer tightly on a firm surface using an oblong block of wood. Seal the final strip Glue the last 2 cm of the final strip firmly to finish the roll. Mark the top Use red dye or a marker to mark the top of the prayer roll.

The Dharma is considered priceless, and access is not limited by money or status. Because it is viewed as something beyond material value, placing a price on teachings is traditionally seen as unnecessary and out of harmony with the spirit of generosity that the Buddha encouraged. Teachers trust that generosity will arise naturally, and students give what they can, when they can. This creates an environment where: anyone can receive teachings sincerity matters more than financial ability generosity is voluntary, not pressured teachers live simply and rely on community support In Western contexts, the situation is different. Centers must operate within a modern economic system, which leads to structured fees, retreat costs, and fundraising. While understandable on a practical level, this can unintentionally create: the impression that payment is required for spiritual progress pressure to donate in order to “make good karma” subtle exclusion of those who cannot afford retreats a sense that access to teachings is gated by money Some organizers may even suggest that paying creates better karma, or treat those who cannot pay with less attention. This reflects cultural and institutional habits, not the essence of the Dharma.
