### Raśmi Vimala Viśuddha Prabhā Nāma Hṛdaya

<Phrase {...phrase} {...props} />

<details>
  <summary>
    Raśmi Vimala Viśuddha Prabhā Nāma Hṛdaya purifies the [five uninterrupted
    negative karmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anantarika-karma).

    If this prayer is put inside a stupa then any being, including evil
    transmigratory beings, who sees the stupa, hears of the stupa, touches
    the stupa, or who is touched by dust or wind that comes from this
    stupa, will be free from all negative karmas. They will be born in the
    realms of happy transmigratory beings and they won't be reborn in
    the lower realms.

    If one offers even a bell to a stupa containing this prayer, all the
    sentient beings in that area, animals or humans, by hearing the sound of
    that bell will be completely purified of the five uninterrupted negative
    karmas. Even just thinking about the stupa purifies the five uninterrupted
    negative karmas.
