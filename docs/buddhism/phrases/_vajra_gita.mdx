<Phrase {...phrase} {...props} />

  <summary>
    This dharmatā song evokes the wisdom of [Ādibuddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi-Buddha)
    in union to channel our energies towards the goal of spiritual enlightenment.

    The union is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of [compassion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81)
    and [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_in_Buddhism),
    depicted as a male [deity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity) in union
    with his female consort through the similar ideas of [interpenetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpenetration_(Buddhism))
    or `coalescence` ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language): युगनद्ध,
    [Romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Sanskrit): Yuganaddha,
    [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 雙連,
    [Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_script): ཟུང་འཇུག,
    [Wylie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration): zung-'jug,
    [THL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THL_Simplified_Phonetic_Transcription): zunjuk),
    using the concept of [Indra's net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net)
    to illustrate this.

    The symbolism is associated with [Anuttarayoga tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuttarayoga_tantra)
    and while there are various interpretations of the symbolism in [twilight language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_language),
    the masculine figure is representing the compassion ([karuṇā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81))
    and skillful means ([upāya-kauśalya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya))
    that have to be developed in order to reach [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism).
    While the feminine partner is representing `wisdom` ([prajñā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praj%C3%B1%C4%81_(Buddhism)))
    which is also necessary to [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism).
    United, the figures symbolize the union necessary to overcome the veils of [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(illusion)),
    the false duality of object and subject.
