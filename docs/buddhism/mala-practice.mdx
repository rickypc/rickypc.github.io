<Welcome />

A beginner's guide to using mala beads for mantra recitation.

This guide explains how to use a mala - whether it has the traditional
108 beads or a smaller variation like 18 beads - for mantra repetition in
Buddhist practice. Even if you're new to the concept, this page will walk you
through everything you need to know, step by step.

### What Is a Mala?

A mala is a string of beads used to count repetitions of a sacred phrase or
mantra during meditation or prayer. Each bead represents one recitation,
helping you stay focused and grounded in your practice.

While the most common mala has 108 beads, there are many valid variations -
such as 54, 27, or 18 beads. These smaller malas are often used
for convenience or travel, and they still support full mantra cycles through
repeated rounds.

### Understanding the Numbers

- 108 beads: Considered a complete cycle. You recite your chosen mantra once
per bead, moving through the entire mala from start to finish.
- 18 beads: A smaller mala that represents a divisor of 108. To complete
a full cycle, you repeat the mala 6 times (18 x 6 = 108).
- Other variations like 27 (4 cycles) or 54 (2 cycles) follow the same principle.

> Many practitioners go beyond a single cycle - reciting 1080 mantras
or more - depending on their intention, commitment, or the specific practice
they're following.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Hold the Mala

    Gently hold the mala in your left hand, keeping it in front of your heart,
    about a palm's width away. This placement honors the connection between
    your mantra and your heart center.

2. Find the Guru Bead

    Locate the large bead at the end of the string - called the guru bead,
    meru, or Buddha bead. This bead marks the start and end of your cycle
    and is not counted.

3. Start Counting

    Begin with the bead next to the guru bead. Use your thumb to pull each bead
    toward you as you recite your chosen mantra.

4. Recite Your Mantra

    For each bead, say your mantra once. For example:
    <code>{aryaTaraPhrase.transliteration.children}</code> ({aryaTaraPhrase.transliteration.title.replace(/ Há¹›daya/, '')} mantra)

5. Continue the Cycle

    Move bead by bead until you reach the guru bead again.

6. Reverse Direction

    Do not cross over the guru bead. Instead, flip the mala
    (turn it around in your hand) and begin again in the opposite direction.

### Using a Smaller Mala (e.g. 18 Beads)

If your mala has fewer than 108 beads, you can still complete a full cycle
by repeating rounds:
- After finishing one round (e.g. 18 beads), flip the mala and begin again.
- Repeat this process until you reach your desired total
(e.g. 6 rounds for 108, or 60 rounds for 1080).
- You can track your rounds mentally, with a counter, or simply by intention.

> The term "flip" here refers to turning the mala around in your hand
so you continue in the opposite direction without crossing the guru bead.

### Closing the Practice

- After completing your final round, pause at the guru bead.
- Take a moment to reflect, offer gratitude, or dedicate the merit of
your practice.
- You may choose to wear your mala on your wrist or neck as a reminder of
your intention.

### Tips for Beginners

- Be patient: It's okay to feel awkward at first - mala practice becomes
natural over time.
- Stay focused: If your mind wanders, gently return to the mantra and the feel
of the beads.
- Personalize your rhythm: You can match your recitation to your breath
or find a pace that feels meditative.
