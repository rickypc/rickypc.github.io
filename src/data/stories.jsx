Although his expertise is broad, he proves that one can really be the master of all trades. I worked with Ricky on several projects, and he surpassed my gradually increased expectations each time. Whether it\'s client- side, server - side, or every - side, he really can accomplish it all. Most importantly, Ricky is one of the nicest and most kind - hearted people you will meet in your lifetime. To any prospective employers for Ricky: it will truly be your loss if you don\'t hire him!',

    content: 'The first time I worked together with Ricky, it was on an important and complex project, which was beginning to fall seriously behind schedule. He literally rescued the project by taking charge of the frontend component and applying his amazing skills to deliver a clean, flexible, and timely implementation. Ricky is a dedicated professional, constantly working towards improving his skills and keeping up-to-date on the technologies he loves and specializes in. (And as we talk about the field of modern frontend web development, this is not an easy thing to do!) Ricky is the type of coworker you can trust with a project, and be sure that it gets done well and on time. I would be delighted to collaborate again with Ricky on any project, and I wholeheartedly recommend him for any software development work he chooses to get involved with.',

During that time I was impressed with the depth of his knowledge (in multiple programming languages, frameworks, and environments), his thoroughness, attention to detail, dedication, and the hard work he put into both projects. I would not hesitate to recommend him and would enjoy working with him again.',
