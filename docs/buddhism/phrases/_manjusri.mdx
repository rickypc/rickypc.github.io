<Phrase {...phrase} {...props} />

<details>
  <summary>
    This prayer will open 5 [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma#Buddha's_teachings) doors:
    - <b>ā</b>dya-anutpannatvād (a door to the insight that all dharmas are unproduced from the very beginning)
    - <b>ra</b>jas (a door to the insight that all dharmas are without dirt)
    - <b>pa</b>ramārtha (a door to the insight that all dharmas have been expounded in the ultimate sense)
    - <b>cya</b>vana (a door to the insight that the decrease or rebirth of any dharma cannot be apprehended, because all dharmas do not decrease, nor are they reborn)
    - <b>nā</b>ma (a door to the insight that the names of all dharmas have vanished; the essential nature behind names cannot be gained or lost)

    This prayer is believed to enhance [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praj%C3%B1%C4%81_(Buddhism))
    and improve one's skills in debating, memory, writing,
    and other [literary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_Buddhist_literature) abilities.
