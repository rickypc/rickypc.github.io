<Welcome />

## Dependent Origination: The Web of Causes

In [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), nothing arises from a
single cause. Life unfolds through **[dependent origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da)**
(pratītyasamutpāda) - a vast network of conditions shaping every moment. Our
birth, personality, challenges, and opportunities all emerge from countless
interconnected factors.

This differs from the Western idea of `A causes B`. Instead, everything arises
because many conditions come together. Our existence is the result of a long
chain of actions, intentions, and circumstances.

## Karma: The Force Behind Rebirth

[Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Karma) is best understood as a
**long-running [personal balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet#Personal)**:

- Good actions add to your [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset).
- Harmful actions become [liabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)).

Our human birth is shaped by **unresolved karmic debts**. Life gives us the
chance to settle them - to learn, to grow, and to free ourselves from old
patterns.

Karma influences every choice, habit, and relationship. You begin to understand
it only when you pause and reflect repeatedly. Over time, the patterns become
clearer, and acceptance naturally follows.

## Why Consciousness Continues

According to Buddhism, consciousness does not begin at birth nor end at death.
It continues because the conditions for it continue - just like a flame passing
from one candle to another.

[Rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)) happens when
unresolved karma and craving create momentum. As long as there are karmic debts
and unfulfilled tendencies, consciousness seeks a new form.

Human birth arises when the right conditions come together:

- karmic momentum,
- a suitable environment,
- and a physical form capable of awareness and growth.

## Why We Are Born Into Specific Lives

Buddhism offers insight into questions many people struggle with:

- Why this family?
- Why these challenges?
- Why these relationships?
- Why this time in history?

The answer is karma - not as punishment, but as **continuity**. We inherit the
momentum of our past actions, and we shape the future through what we do now.

We are born because there are still lessons to learn, qualities to develop, and
karmic debts to resolve.

## Is Karma Real?

It's easy to doubt karma. We see good people suffer and bad people succeed.

The Buddha explained that karma ripens only when conditions allow it. A corrupt
person in a corrupt environment may not face consequences quickly. But in a
place that values honesty, the same actions would bring results much sooner.

> It is easy to doubt the law of [kamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism).
  We see so many people who do good deeds and seem to gain no benefit.
  So many people do bad things and become rich and successful.
>
> The [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha) said that the results
  of [kamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism) will only appear rapidly
  if the surroundings allow it. For example, a corrupt person in a corrupt
  environment will receive the kammic results of his bad actions much more slowly
  than a corrupt person in an environment that values honesty.
  Sooner or later, however, the results will manifest.
>
> Most important to note is that every time that we act with a good, kind,
  noble intention then those qualities are immediately strengthened in our hearts.
  And so with selfish, cruel intentions.
  This strengthening of good and bad qualities in the heart is
  the perceivable result of [kamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism),
  which we do not merely believe in, but can see for ourselves.
>
> -- [Ajahn Jayasāro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Jayas%C4%81ro)

Most importantly, karma is visible **right now**:

- Every kind intention strengthens kindness.
- Every selfish intention strengthens selfishness.

This immediate shaping of the mind is the part of karma we can directly observe.

## How Truth Is Known

The Buddha taught that [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_in_Buddhism)
is not discovered through tradition, scripture,
[logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning), or authority. Real
understanding comes from **[direct experience](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Dhammapada/Chapter_6)**.

> Now, [Kālāmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81l%C4%81ma), don't go by
reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture,
by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views,
by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher'.
When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful;
these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the observant;
these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness' —
then you should enter & remain in them.
>
> -- [Kalama Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta)

The Kalama Sutta encourages us to trust only what we can verify in our own
lives:

- Does it reduce suffering?
- Does it bring clarity?
- Does it lead to peace?

If it does, follow it. If it doesn't, let it go.

## What About God?

Buddhism does not rely on a creator God. The Buddha is not a deity - he is a
teacher who showed the path.

We create our own karma, and we are responsible for resolving it. It's like
taking out a mortgage: no one else - not even Buddha or God - can pay it off
for you.

The path is ours to walk.
