<Welcome />

## The Three Trainings

The Buddha summarized the path to liberation in three essential disciplines:

### **1. Ethical Conduct (Sīla)**
Living in a way that avoids harm and supports clarity of mind.
Ethics create the foundation for stable meditation and wholesome intentions.

### **2. Meditation (Samādhi)**
Training the mind to become calm, focused, and steady.
A concentrated mind can see reality clearly and respond wisely.

### **3. Wisdom (Paññā)**
Understanding the true nature of existence - impermanence, suffering, and
not-self. Wisdom cuts through ignorance, the root of all suffering.

These three trainings support each other: ethics stabilizes the mind,
meditation deepens clarity, and wisdom transforms understanding.

## The Six Perfections

For those following the bodhisattva path, the **Six Perfections** (Pāramitās)
describe the qualities that lead to awakening:

- **Generosity (Dāna)**

  Giving freely, reducing attachment, and opening the heart.

- **Ethical Conduct (Sīla)**

  Acting with integrity and kindness.

- **Patience (Kṣānti)**

  Meeting difficulties with calm and understanding.

- **Joyful Effort (Vīrya)**

  Sustaining energy and enthusiasm for practice.

- **Meditative Concentration (Dhyāna)**

  Developing deep stability and clarity of mind.

- **Wisdom (Prajñā)**

  Seeing reality as it truly is.

Practicing these perfections gradually transforms the mind and prepares it for
full awakening.

## Stages of the Path

The Buddhist path unfolds gradually, through understanding and direct experience:

### **1. Recognizing Suffering**
Seeing clearly that life contains stress, dissatisfaction, and instability.

### **2. Understanding the Causes**
Realizing that craving, ignorance, and unskillful habits create suffering.

### **3. Cultivating the Path**
Practicing ethics, meditation, and wisdom to weaken the causes of suffering.

### **4. Experiencing Insight**
Seeing impermanence, not-self, and dependent origination directly.

### **5. Letting Go**
Releasing attachment, craving, and the illusions that bind us to samsara.

### **6. Liberation**
The end of suffering — nibbāna — a state of profound peace, clarity, and freedom.

## Walking the Path

The path to enlightenment is not about belief; it is about practice.
Each moment offers a chance to cultivate kindness, clarity, and understanding.

Progress is gradual, shaped by:

- consistent meditation,
- ethical living,
- mindful awareness,
- and sincere effort.

With patience and dedication, the path becomes clearer, and the mind moves
steadily toward liberation.
