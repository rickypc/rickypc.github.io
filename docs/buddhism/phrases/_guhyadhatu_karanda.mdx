### Guhyadhātukaraṇḍa

<Phrase {...phrase} {...props} />

<details>
  <summary>
    Guhyadhātukaraṇḍa purifies the negative karma of the ten non-virtuous actions
    and will liberate from the [eight hot hells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraka_(Buddhism)#Eight_Hot_narakas),
    including the unbearable hell ([Avīci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Av%C4%ABci#Details_about_Av%C4%ABci)).
    This prayer also purifies the [five uninterrupted negative karmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anantarika-karma).

    By printing this prayer just once, we collect the same amount of merit as
    making offerings to 100,000 x 10 million x 100 billion Buddhas.
    Having made offerings to as many Buddhas as there are in ninety-nine
    sesame seed pods - that is how much merit we create and we are always guided
    by that many Buddhas.
