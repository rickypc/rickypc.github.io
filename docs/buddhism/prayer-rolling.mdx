<Welcome />

## What We Need

- Prayer strips on [saffron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron) color paper (e.g. <Link href="/pdf/arya-tara.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Open Ārya Tārā prayer roll">Ārya Tārā prayer strips</Link>).
- A pure incense stick (coreless).
- Thin cotton cloth ([saffron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron) or deity specific color).
- A paper glue stick.
- A red marker.
- A scissors.
- An oblong block of wood.

## For Filling In Buddha Statue / [Stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa)

The video shows [how to roll prayers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwSm7r5ppww).
The [essential prayers for holy objects](https://fpmt.org/wp-content/uploads/teachers/zopa/advice/essential-mantras-for-holy-objects/essentialmantrasholyobjects_c5.pdf) will explain further on the topic.

- Cut off a piece of pure incense stick to the width of the prayer strip.
- Roll the first sheet with the pure incense stick glued inside, beginning at
  the "head" (start) of the text, which faces inwards.
- Hold the top and bottom of the pure incense stick to roll it easier.
- Additional strips are then added with the same orientation, in groups of one or more,
  depending upon our dexterity, with an overlap of about 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre)
  towards the end of the previous strips.
- Tighten the prayer roll by rolling them on a firm surface with an oblong block of wood.
- Finish the roll with a single strip, gluing firmly the final 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre).
- Mark the top of the prayer roll.
- Wrap the outside of the prayer roll with cloth to the exact width of the prayer roll.
  Glue the cloth all around and over the junction of its ends.
- Write the prayer name and the repetition numbers on a small piece of paper
  and glue that outside of the prayer roll.

## For [Prayer Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel)

The steps to roll prayer strips for [prayer wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel)
is almost the same as the one for filling in the Buddha statue / [stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa).
Except we roll the strip to face outwards without the pure incense stick and use the gap to slide in
the prayer roll to [prayer wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel) rod.
