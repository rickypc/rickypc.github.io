<Welcome />

The core teaching of [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) is [Dependent Origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da) induced by [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Karma).

<Pratityasamutpada />

## Karma Oversimplification

Karma is like a very long [personal balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet#Personal), where good karma is an [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) and bad karma is a [liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)).

We are born as human being because of karma debts and we need to pay those off.

## Paying Off Karma Debts

Paying off karma debts comes with the benefit of reducing the risk of karma due at unexpected times.
Not to mention that being [reborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)) as a human being is not a guarantee.

When some of the karma debts are paid off, we contribute towards the permanent cessation of suffering.
It is indeed possible to end the cycle of suffering ([nirodha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirodha)), and to attain a state of inner peace and freedom ([nibbāna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism))).

## Liberation Through Prayers

The most practical way to pay off karma debts is through [liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Paths_to_liberation) prayers.
(e.g. [Ārya Tārā Atiyoga](arya-tara-atiyoga))

## Is This For Real?

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) helped us answer a lot of questions like:

- Why are we born in certain families?
- Why do we meet some group of people?
- Why are we born at all?
- What's the purpose of our life?
- Why are we dying?

The answer to those questions is all our own doing.
We caused all those and are in full control of our own decisions and lives.

The benefit of paying off karma debts outweighs the risk of not doing it.
[Life as a human being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_beings_in_Buddhism#Qualities_of_human_life) is precious because it gives us a better opportunity to pay off our karma debts.
A pig would have a harder time doing liberation prayer.

[Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha) says [common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense)
and [logical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning) are insufficient
to determine the [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_in_Buddhism).
We can be sure of what to follow, only through our own experience or the experience of [the wise](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Dhammapada/Chapter_6) ones.

> “Now, [Kālāmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81l%C4%81ma), don’t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture,
by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views,
by probability, or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’
When you know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are skillful;
these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the observant;
these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness’—
then you should enter & remain in them.
>
> -- [Kalama Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta)

The Buddha proceeds to [list the criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta#Discerning_Religious_Teachings) by which any sensible person
can decide which teachings to accept as true.
Do not blindly believe religious teachings, just because they are claimed to be true,
or even through the application of various methods or techniques.
Direct knowledge grounded in one's own experience can be called upon.

The Buddha proposes not a passive acceptance but, rather,
constant questioning and personal testing to identify those truths
which verifiably reduce one's own [suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering) or misery ([dukkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha)).

## How About God?

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) does not focus on God but rather on ourselves.
[Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha) is not a God but a spiritual teacher.

We are the one who accumulates bad karma, and we are the one who has the responsibility to pay for it.
If we took a mortgage, we don't expect Buddha or God to pay for it, do we?
