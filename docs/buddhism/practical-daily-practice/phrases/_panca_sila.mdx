    The easiest way to avoid new karma debts is to follow
    [five precepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_precepts#In_P%C4%81li_tradition).
    Think of them like gentle reminders to stay kind and careful:
    > 1. **Don't hurt living beings**
         Every creature wants to live. Be gentle with people, animals, even tiny bugs.
    > 2. **Don't take what isn't yours**
         If it doesn't belong to you, leave it. Sharing is good, stealing is not.
    > 3. **Don't break trust in love**
         Be honest and kind in friendships and relationships.
         Don't cause harm with your choices.
    > 4. **Don't lie**
         Words can heal or hurt. Speak the truth, and use words to help, not harm.
    > 5. **Don't cloud your mind**
         Stay clear and mindful. Avoid things that make you lose control
         or forget kindness.

    Following these precepts keeps your "karmic balance sheet" clean - fewer
    new debts, fewer complications, more peace.
