<Welcome />

The core teaching of [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) is [Dependent Origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da) induced by [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Karma).

## Karma Oversimplification

Karma is like a very long [personal balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet#Personal), where good karma is an [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) and bad karma is a [liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)).

We are born as human being because of karma debts and we need to pay those off.

## Paying Off Karma Debts

Paying off karma debts comes with the benefit of reducing the risk of karma due at unexpected times.
Not to mention that being [reborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)) as a human being is not guaranteed.

When some of the karma debts are paid off, we will have a better future.
That future could be going to [heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology#Heavens) or could be [reborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)) as a human being.

## Liberation Through Prayers

The most practical way to pay off karma debts is through [liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Paths_to_liberation) prayers.
(e.g. [Ārya Tārā Atiyoga](arya-tara-atiyoga))

## Is This For Real?

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) helped us answer a lot of questions like:

- Why are we born in certain families?
- Why do we meet some group of people?
- Why are we born at all?
- What's the purpose of our life?
- Why are we dying?

The answer to those questions is all our own doing.
We caused all those and are in full control of our own lives.

The benefit of paying off karma debts outweighs the risk of not doing it.
Life as a human being is precious because it gives us a better opportunity to pay off our karma debts.
A pig would have a harder time doing liberation prayer.

## How About God?

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) does not focus on God but rather on ourselves.
[Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha) is not a God but a spiritual teacher.

We are the one who accumulates bad karma, and we are the one who has the responsibility to pay for it.
If we took a mortgage, we don't expect Buddha or God to pay for it, do we?
