title: Notes

<Welcome />

These notes come from my ongoing study and practice of Buddhism.

They began in the early 1990s, when I learned from two Tibetan monks from India
at a small temple in [Surabaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya),
Indonesia. I no longer remember their names, but I now know with certainty that
they were monks of the **[Drikung Kagyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drikung_Kagyu)**
lineage - one of the main branches of the
[Kagyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagyu) school of Tibetan Buddhism. They
wore the deep maroon robes typical of the Kagyu tradition, with small touches
of yellow in the upper garments, a style I only later learned to recognize.

One of the earliest impressions that stayed with me was the presence of a
[Tara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(Buddhism)) statue in the temple.
Even as a teenager, I felt an immediate and natural connection to her—something
I didn't fully understand at the time. That early affinity never faded. Tara
would later become central in my Dzogchen practice, and she remains my
[yidam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yidam) today. In hindsight, this thread
of connection feels like the most continuous element of my path.

Another memory that confirmed the Drikung Kagyu lineage was the initiation
ceremony for a newly ordained monk. The [teachers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu)
explained the meaning of the small dot marks placed on the shaved head—symbols
representing vows, discipline, and stages of monastic commitment. It was a
simple conversation shared between friends and teachers, but it reflected a
distinctly Drikung way of transmitting the tradition: direct, humble, and
quietly profound. Looking back, there is no doubt that my earliest training
came from this lineage.

Although I later continued my studies through
**[Dzogchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen)**, rooted in the
**[Nyingma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyingma)** tradition, I still regard
those first two Drikung Kagyu monks as my primary teachers. The teachings I've
received since then complement rather than contradict what I learned in those
early years.

These notes are not authoritative or comprehensive. They're simply a way for me
to organize what I've learned - concepts, practices, and reflections - and to
make them available in case they're helpful to others.
