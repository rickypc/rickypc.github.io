<Welcome />

## What Happens at Death

Buddhism teaches that death is not an end but a **transition**.
The mind continues, carrying karmic imprints into the next life.

Key stages often described:

- **Dissolution of the elements** - body and senses gradually weaken.
- **Inner experiences** - visions, lights, or dreamlike states may arise.
- **The bardo** - an intermediate state where the mind is clear but unstable.
- **Movement toward rebirth** - guided by karma, intention, and mental habits.

The quality of the mind at the moment of death has a powerful influence on the
next rebirth, which is why calmness, clarity, and wholesome thoughts matter.

## How to Prepare

Preparation for death is not morbid - it is a way to live more fully and
fearlessly.

### **1. Cultivate a steady mind**
Regular meditation helps the mind remain calm and clear during transitions.

### **2. Live ethically**
Wholesome actions create supportive conditions for a peaceful death and a
positive rebirth.

### **3. Reflect on impermanence**
Remembering that everything changes reduces fear and attachment.

### **4. Strengthen compassion**
A compassionate mind is naturally peaceful and less self‑centered at death.

### **5. Practice letting go**
Release grudges, regrets, and clinging.
A lighter heart leads to a smoother transition.

### **6. Prepare practically**
- Keep wishes known to loved ones.
- Maintain a simple, peaceful environment.
- Use mantras or prayers that calm the mind.

Preparation is not about controlling death - it is about meeting it with
awareness and dignity.

## How to Help Others

Supporting someone who is dying is an act of profound compassion.

Ways to help:

- **Create a calm environment**

  Soft light, gentle presence, minimal noise.

- **Encourage wholesome thoughts**

  Remind them of kindness they've done, or recite mantras softly.

- **Avoid emotional pressure**

  Let them rest; avoid conversations that create fear or attachment.

- **Offer presence, not solutions**

  Simply being there with a peaceful mind is deeply supportive.

- **Respect their beliefs and wishes**

  Honor their spiritual or personal preferences.

- **After death**

  Maintain a quiet, respectful atmosphere.
  Dedicate merit or prayers for their peaceful transition.

## Meeting Death With Wisdom

Death is a natural part of existence.
When understood clearly, it becomes less frightening and more meaningful.

Preparing for death - and helping others through it - strengthens compassion,
reduces fear, and deepens understanding of the path.

In this way, death becomes not an ending, but a continuation of practice.
