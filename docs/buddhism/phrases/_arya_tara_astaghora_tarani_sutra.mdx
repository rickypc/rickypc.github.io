<Phrase {...phrase} {...props} />

<details>
  <summary>
    [Tārā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(Buddhism)) explains that the fate
    of each being is the result of past negative actions
    and that virtuous conduct is the only way to avoid suffering in the future.
    Tārā describes the path to liberation using a series of evocative metaphors
    and also offers a sacred [dhāraṇī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharani)
    as a means to help others achieve liberation from [saṃsāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra).
    She also outlines for recitation a praise of her myriad qualities,
    in particular of her ability to protect beings from the [eight dangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(Buddhism)#As_a_popular_saviour_deity).
