title: What Is Buddhism?
---

<Welcome />

## A Path, Not a Belief System
Buddhism is not built on blind faith, commandments, or a creator God.
It is a **path of understanding** - a way to see reality clearly and reduce
suffering. The Buddha did not ask anyone to believe him; he asked people to
test his teachings through their own experience.

Buddhism is about learning how the mind works, why we suffer, and how we can
free ourselves from the patterns that keep us stuck.

## What Buddhism Is Not

Buddhism is often misunderstood. It is **not**:

- a religion that requires worship
- a system of dogma you must accept
- a promise that someone else will save you
- a set of rituals you must perform

It is a practical method for understanding life and transforming the mind.

## Why People Study Buddhism

People turn to Buddhism for many reasons:

- To understand why life feels difficult
- To make sense of suffering, loss, and change
- To find clarity in a confusing world
- To develop compassion and wisdom
- To break old habits and create a better future
- To understand karma and rebirth
- To seek liberation from the cycle of suffering

Buddhism offers answers to deep questions:

- Why am I here?
- Why do I experience certain challenges?
- Why do I repeat the same patterns?
- How can I live with more peace and purpose?

It provides a framework for understanding life as it truly is, not as we wish
it to be.
