### Bodhigarbhālaṃkāralakṣa

<Phrase {...phrase} {...props} />

<details>
  <summary>
    By putting even just one prayer of the Bodhigarbhālaṃkāralakṣa inside a [stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa),
    it brings the same merit as having built 100,000 [stupas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa) -
    whether the [stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa) is gigantic
    like [Bodh Gayā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodh_Gaya) or tiny like
    the size of a finger. Then, if you dedicate this merit for sentient beings,
    for their happiness up to full enlightenment, they receive unbelievable
    benefits and you receive unbelievable merit.

    One collects the merit of having made offerings to all the [Buddhas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha),
    to all the [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_paths_to_liberation),
    and to all the [Sangha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangha). Because when you make
    offerings to a [stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa) containing
    the 100,000 Ornaments of Enlightenment prayer, you are not only
    making offering to a [stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa). It becomes an offering to
    the [Three Rare Sublime Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refuge_in_Buddhism) -
    all the [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha),
    [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_paths_to_liberation),
    and [Sangha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangha) that exist in the
    ten directions, in any universe.
