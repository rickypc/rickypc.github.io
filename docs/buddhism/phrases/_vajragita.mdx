    >  Without birth and so without cease,
    >  Not coming or going, but filling all,
    >  Blissful dharma sublime and unmoving,
    >  Sky-like, freed and without stain,
    >  Rootless, and also without support,
    >  Homeless, unattached, a dharma profound,
    >  Ever free, ever vast, equality effortless,
    >  Subject to neither bondage nor liberation,
    >  An ever present palace encompassing all,
    >  Beyond logic and reason.
    >  So vast, so grand, the space of the sky!
    >  Blazing dharma, the core of the sun and the moon,
    >  Instant presence, now it's so plain to see,
    >  A mountain of vajra, a lotus so immense
    >  The sun, a lion, this wisdom song.
    >  A sound so great, a music beyond compare,
    >  A pleasure reaching to the ends of space,
    >  A buddha equal to all of the buddhas,
    >  Samantabhadra the vast, the peak of dharma,
    >  In the womb of Samantabhadrī, her sky-like space,
    >  Open clarity, instantly present—the ever great perfection!
