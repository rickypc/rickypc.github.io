<Welcome />

## What Transmission Traditionally Means

In traditional Buddhist cultures, transmission was a simple, practical way to
ensure teachings were passed down accurately.
The three main forms are:

- **Lung** - reading transmission
- **Wang** - empowerment
- **Tri** - instruction or explanation

These were originally meant to support understanding, not to restrict access.

## Lung: Reading Transmission

A lung is the teacher reading a text aloud. Its purpose is:

- to connect you to the lineage of the text
- to confirm the teaching has been passed on
- to encourage respectful study

It was never meant to be a barrier or a requirement for basic practice.

## Wang: Empowerment

Empowerment introduces a student to a specific meditation or deity practice.
Traditionally, it helps:

- create a sense of connection
- prepare the mind
- inspire confidence

It was not originally tied to money, status, or exclusivity.

## Tri: Instruction

Tri is simply the teacher explaining how to practice.
It is the most essential part, because without clear instruction:

- practice becomes confusing
- misunderstandings grow
- progress slows

Instruction is meant to be accessible and practical.

## How These Became Complicated in Modern Contexts

As Buddhism spread into new cultures, several issues emerged:

- teachings became tied to retreat fees
- permissions became gatekeeping tools
- lineage was used as a marker of authority
- access to practices became monetized
- students felt pressured to “qualify” through payment

This can create fear, confusion, or the sense that practice is only for those
who can afford it.

## Retreats and Donations

Retreats can be valuable:

- focused time
- community support
- direct guidance
- fewer distractions

But modern retreat culture sometimes creates problems:

- high costs
- travel requirements
- pressure to attend
- implied hierarchy between those who can and cannot go

### When "donation" becomes pressure

Some teachers, hosts, or coordinators may say that **paying creates good karma**.
While generosity is indeed a wholesome action, this message can become distorted.

Unhealthy versions include:

- implying that paying more creates "better karma"
- suggesting that those who cannot pay are missing out spiritually
- ignoring or brushing off students who have limited means
- treating financial contribution as a measure of sincerity

This creates a harmful dynamic where money becomes tied to spiritual worth.
In traditional Buddhist cultures, generosity was **voluntary**, not transactional.

## Cultural Differences: Eastern and Western Approaches

In many Eastern Buddhist cultures, teachings are offered freely. The Dharma is
considered priceless, and access is not limited by money or status. Because it
is viewed as something beyond material value, placing a price on teachings is
traditionally seen as unnecessary and out of harmony with the spirit of
generosity that the Buddha encouraged. Teachers trust that generosity will
arise naturally, and students give what they can, when they can.

This creates an environment where:

- anyone can receive teachings
- sincerity matters more than financial ability
- generosity is voluntary, not pressured
- teachers live simply and rely on community support

In Western contexts, the situation is different.
Centers must operate within a modern economic system, which leads to structured
fees, retreat costs, and fundraising. While understandable on a practical
level, this can unintentionally create:

- the impression that payment is required for spiritual progress
- pressure to donate in order to “make good karma”
- subtle exclusion of those who cannot afford retreats
- a sense that access to teachings is gated by money

Some organizers may even suggest that paying creates better karma, or treat
those who cannot pay with less attention. This reflects cultural and
institutional habits, not the essence of the Dharma.

Understanding these differences helps practitioners avoid confusion and
remember that sincerity, effort, and ethical conduct - not financial
contribution - are what truly support the path.

## Recognizing Healthy vs. Unhealthy Dynamics

Healthy transmission feels:

- open
- encouraging
- supportive
- respectful of your situation

Unhealthy dynamics include:

- pressure to donate
- claims that payment improves karma
- subtle exclusion of those who cannot pay
- fear-based messaging
- using lineage or permission as leverage
- implying spiritual progress depends on money

These are cultural distortions, not Dharma.

## Practicing Without Fear

You can practice sincerely even if:

- you cannot attend retreats
- you cannot afford donations
- you do not have access to every empowerment
- you learn from teachers outside major institutions

The Buddha emphasized personal verification, ethical conduct, and direct
experience.

Transmission can support your path, but it is not a gate you must pay to enter.

## A Clear, Balanced Approach

Understanding lung, wang, and tri helps you navigate modern Buddhism without
confusion. Respect tradition, but stay grounded:

- take teachings that help
- question anything that feels pressured
- trust your own experience
- remember that awakening is not for sale

The Dharma is meant to be lived, not purchased.
