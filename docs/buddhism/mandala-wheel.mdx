## Instructions

Use a mixture of honey, butter, and sugar together with
the [gemstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone) powder,
red and white [sandalwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandalwood) (sweet paste offering) to stick
the [Jambhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambhala)
and [Vasudhārā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudhara) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel
together - as if they were embracing -
with [Jambhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambhala) on top facing downwards.

After they are stuck together, make sure to mark the outside of
the [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheels
to identify both [Jambhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambhala)
and the placement of the heads of the deities.
When the [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheels are placed inside the statue,
[Jambhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambhala) will be on the top
and the heads of the deities will be directed towards the back of the statue
(as if they "stood up", they would be facing the same direction as the statue).

Beneath the [Vasudhārā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudhara) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel,
add the [Ganapati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel,
the [Aṣṭamaṅgala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtamangala) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel (both facing up),
and finally the [Viśvavajra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajra) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel. The [Viśvavajra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajra) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel
faces down toward the statue's base like
[Jambhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambhala) [maṇḍala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala) wheel.

These can all be stuck together with the sweet paste offering.

Wrap all of them together with a nice cloth.
