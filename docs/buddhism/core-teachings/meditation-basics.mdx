<Welcome />

## Why Meditate

Meditation is the heart of Buddhist practice. It trains the mind to become
clear, steady, and aware. Without meditation, understanding remains shallow and
easily shaken by emotions or habits.

We meditate to:

- see reality more clearly,
- reduce suffering at its root,
- calm the mind,
- cultivate compassion and wisdom,
- and understand how thoughts and intentions shape our lives.

Meditation is not about escaping the world - it is about understanding it.

## How to Start

Beginning meditation is simple. You don't need special tools or rituals.

A basic approach:

1. Sit comfortably with a straight but relaxed posture.
2. Rest your attention on the breath - the natural in-and-out flow.
3. When the mind wanders (and it will), gently return to the breath.
4. Stay patient, kind, and consistent.

Start with short sessions - even five minutes is enough. Over time, the mind
becomes more stable and less reactive.

## Types of Meditation

Buddhism includes many forms of meditation, but most fall into two broad
categories:

### **1. Calm-Abiding Meditation (Samatha)**
Develops stability, focus, and tranquility.
Common methods include:

- breath awareness
- counting breaths
- focusing on a single object

Samatha steadies the mind so it can see clearly.

### **2. Insight Meditation (Vipassanā)**
Develops wisdom by observing the nature of experience.
Practices include:

- noticing sensations
- observing thoughts without reacting
- seeing impermanence, suffering, and not-self

Vipassanā reveals how the mind creates suffering - and how to let go.

Both types support each other. Calm leads to clarity; clarity deepens calm.

## Common Mistakes

Beginners often struggle with the same challenges:

- **Expecting quick results**

  Meditation is gradual. Progress comes from consistency, not intensity.

- **Trying to stop thoughts**

  The goal is not to silence the mind but to observe it without getting pulled
  in.

- **Judging the practice**

  "Good" or "bad" sessions don't matter. What matters is showing up.

- **Forcing concentration**

  Meditation should be gentle. Forcing creates tension, not clarity.

- **Being discouraged by wandering thoughts**

  Returning to the breath *is* the practice. Every return strengthens awareness.

## The Foundation of All Progress

Meditation is how we train the mind to see clearly. It supports ethical living,
wisdom, compassion, and every step of the path.

With patience and steady effort, meditation becomes a source of stability,
insight, and deep inner freedom.
