<Welcome />

## The Four Noble Truths

The Buddha summarized the entire path in four profound insights:

- **There is suffering (dukkha).**

  Life contains stress, dissatisfaction, and instability.

- **Suffering has causes.**

  Craving, ignorance, and unskillful habits create ongoing pain.

- **Suffering can end.**

  When its causes are removed, freedom becomes possible.

- **There is a path to the end of suffering.**

  The Noble Eightfold Path leads to clarity, peace, and liberation.

These truths are not beliefs - they are realities to be observed in one's own
experience.

## The Three Marks of Existence

All conditioned things share three characteristics:

- **Impermanence (anicca)**

  Everything changes. Nothing stays the same.

- **Suffering or unsatisfactoriness (dukkha)**

  Clinging to what changes creates stress.

- **Not-self (anattā)**

  No permanent, unchanging “self” can be found in body or mind.

Seeing these clearly loosens attachment and opens the door to wisdom.

## Dependent Origination

Dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) explains how suffering arises through
a chain of causes and conditions. Nothing exists independently; everything
depends on countless factors.

This teaching shows:

- why we are reborn,
- how habits shape our lives,
- and how liberation becomes possible when the chain is broken.

Understanding dependent origination reveals the mechanics of samsara and the
path to freedom.

## Karma & Rebirth

Karma is intentional action - thoughts, words, and deeds that leave imprints on
the mind. These imprints shape future experiences, including rebirth.

Key points:

- Good intentions strengthen wholesome qualities.
- Harmful intentions strengthen unwholesome qualities.
- Karma ripens when conditions allow it.
- Rebirth continues as long as craving and ignorance persist.

Human birth arises from a mix of past actions and present conditions, offering
a rare chance to grow and resolve karmic debts.

## Bodhicitta

Bodhicitta is the awakened heart - the intention to attain enlightenment for
the benefit of all beings.

It has two aspects:

- **Aspiring bodhicitta:**

  The wish to help all beings become free from suffering.

- **Engaging bodhicitta:**

  Taking action through compassion, wisdom, and the path of practice.

Bodhicitta transforms spiritual practice from personal improvement into a
boundless commitment to the welfare of all.
