## Instructions

### For Buddha Statue or [Stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa)

The video demonstrates [how to roll prayer strips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwSm7r5ppww). Additional [videos](https://bodhipath.org/centers/natural-bridge-stupa-mantra-rolling/) may show
techniques using wider strips. For deeper understanding, refer to
the [essential prayers for holy objects](https://fpmt.org/wp-content/uploads/teachers/zopa/advice/essential-mantras-for-holy-objects/essentialmantrasholyobjects_c5.pdf).

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Prepare your incense stick

    Cut a piece of pure, coreless incense to match the width of
    your prayer strip. This will go inside the very first strip.

2. Roll the first strip

    Glue the incense stick inside the first prayer strip. Start rolling
    from the "head" of the text (the beginning), with the text facing inward.
    Roll this strip all the way.

3. Understand the rolling pattern

    Prayer rolls follow a pattern. There are two main types:

    - Standard roll (6 strips total):
      - First strip: roll all the way (with incense stick)
      - Second strip: roll all the way
      - One group of 3 strips: added one by one with 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre) overlap between each
      - Final strip: roll all the way

    - Expanded roll (12, 18, 36 strips, etc.):
      - First strip: roll all the way (with incense stick)
      - Second strip: roll all the way
      - Multiple groups of 3 strips: each added one by one with 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre) overlap
      - Final strip: roll all the way

    <br/>
    > **Important**: When rolling a group of 3 strips, do not stack them.
    Add the first strip, roll 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre), then add the second, roll 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre),
    then add the third and roll all the way.

4. Keep rolling with control

    As you add strips (single or grouped), hold both ends of the incense stick
    to help guide the roll and keep it tight.

5. Tighten the roll

    Once all strips are added, roll the prayer tightly on a firm surface using
    an oblong block of wood.

6. Seal the final strip

    Glue the last 2 [cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre) of the final strip firmly to finish the roll.

7. Mark the top

    Use red dye or a marker to mark the top of the prayer roll.

8. Wrap with cloth

    Wrap the roll in cloth that matches its width. Glue the cloth all around,
    covering the seam where the ends meet.

9. Label the roll

    Write the prayer name and the number of repetitions on a small piece
    of paper. Glue it to the outside of the roll.

### For [Prayer Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel)

  <span className="col col--10">
    The process of rolling prayer strips for a [prayer wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel) is similar to
    that [for a Buddha statue or stupa](#for-buddha-statue-or-stupa) - with a few key differences.

    Step-by-Step Guide:

    1. Orientation matters

        Roll the prayer strips so the text faces outward.
        Unlike the statue/stupa method, do not include a pure incense stick.
        Leave a central gap so the finished roll can slide onto
        the [prayer wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel) rod.

    2. Start with the right strip

        Begin with a <Link href="/pdf/cintamani-dharmacakra-yasti.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Open Cintāmaṇi Dharmacakra Yaṣṭi prayer strip">prayer wheel life force pillar</Link> strip, or a smaller
        prayer wheel strip. Follow with Buddha statue/stupa prayer strips
        (e.g. Āryatārā <Link href="/pdf/arya-tara-wheel.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Open Āryatārā prayer wheel">prayer wheel</Link> strips and <Link href="/pdf/arya-tara.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Open Āryatārā prayer roll">Buddha statue/stupa</Link> strips).

    3. Add symbolic elements

        Place the <Link href="/pdf/prayer-wheels.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Open prayer wheels">earth wheel</Link> at the bottom of the prayer roll, facing upward,
        and the <Link href="/pdf/prayer-wheels.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Open prayer wheels">sky wheel</Link> at the top, facing downward.
